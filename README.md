# Z---interpreter-269-Bites-
This is a little Python program that took me a couple hours to make. It was my failed attempt at the world record for smallest language interpreter. My attempt had 269 bytes while the world record had around 160.
Just a little warning this only has one variable you can edit so you only have one value you can work with.
Here are the commands:

+: Does exactly what you think it does. Ads one. 
-: Same as above except subtracts instead of ads.
(: Loop back to the character “)”  in the program if the value is not zero.
&: Prince the value in unicode

Have fun!
